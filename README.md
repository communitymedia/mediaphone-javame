MediaPhone (Java ME version)
==========

MediaPhone is a Java ME storytelling and multimedia narrative application. It's based on [Com-Phone](https://github.com/communitymedia/mediaphone), and designed to allow you to achieve the same thing when Android smartphones aren't available.

Both source and compiled versions are made available for convenience. Please see [release-unsigned](https://github.com/communitymedia/mediaphone-javame/tree/master/release-unsigned) to download the (unsigned) jar package.
